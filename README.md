# Network UPS Tools

## Overview

This guide contains information on how to set up your environment to respond to power failure events automatically.

This guide deals specifically with the following types of devices:
- APC Power Supplies
- ESXi
- Network UPS Tools
- OpenNMS
- Synology
- WinNUT

This is a solution that I just wrapped up this evening. I may update this guide in the future--but I am not planning on spending a lot of time maintaining this repository.
